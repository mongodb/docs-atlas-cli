   To use the {+atlas-cli+} with {+avs+}, you must create an |service| 
   deployment with MongoDB 7.0.2 or later. If you created an |service|
   deployment with an earlier MongoDB version, you don't get the latest
   MongoDB version automatically. You must delete the earlier images and
   create a new |service| deployment.
