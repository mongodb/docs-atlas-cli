Use the {+atlas-cli+} to work with |service|, including using |fts| 
and {+avs+}, throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from 
your local environment to the cloud.

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-deployments-preview.rst

With the ``atlas deployments`` commands, you can perform the following
actions:

- Create and manage local |service| deployments. Local |service| 
  deployments reside on your computer and provide a non-production 
  environment for development.
- Create and manage |service| cloud deployments. Cloud |service| 
  deployments reside in the cloud for non-production and production use.
- Manage |fts| and {+avs+} indexes for your local and cloud |service| 
  deployments.

.. note::

   For local |service| deployments, you can manage only deployments that
   you created with the ``atlas deployments`` command. If you created a 
   local|service| deployment without using the {+atlas-cli+}, you can't
   manage that deployment with the {+atlas-cli+}.

You can use only ``atlas deployments`` {+atlas-cli+} commands with 
local |service| deployments. You can use all {+atlas-cli+} commands, 
including ``atlasdeployments`` commands,  with cloud |service| 
deployments.

Supported Actions
-----------------

You can perform the following actions with the ``atlas deployments`` 
command  for local and cloud |service| deployments including, but not limited to:

- **Set up** a new |service| deployment.
   
- **List** |service| deployments.
  
- **Connect** with {+mongosh+} or :compass:`Compass </>`, or return the 
  connection string for an |service| deployment.

- **Pause or start** an |service| deployment.
  
- **Delete** an |service| deployment.
  
- **Access logs** for an |service| deployment.
  
- **Create or manage Atlas Search and {+avs+} indexes** to run a 
  full-text search or semantic search on an |service| deployment.
