Use the {+atlas-cli+} to work with |service|, including using |fts| 
and performing vector searches, throughout the entire software 
development lifecycle, from your local environment to the cloud.

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-deployments-preview.rst

With the ``atlas deployments`` commands, you can perform the following
actions with the {+atlas-cli+}:

- Create local MongoDB deployments. Local deployments reside on your
  computer and provide a non-production environment for development.
- Create |service| cloud deployments. |service| hosts deployments in
  the cloud for both non-production and production use.
- Manage local {+clusters+} that you deployed with ``atlas
  deployments``.
- Manage all MongoDB |service| cloud deployments.

.. note::

   For local MongoDB deployments, you can manage only deployments that
   you created with ``atlas deployments``. If you created a local
   MongoDB {+cluster+} without using the {+atlas-cli+}, you can't
   manage that {+cluster+} with the {+atlas-cli+}.

Only ``atlas deployments`` {+atlas-cli+} commands work on local MongoDB
deployments. All {+atlas-cli+} commands, including ``atlas
deployments`` commands, work on MongoDB |service| cloud deployments.

Supported Actions
-----------------

The actions you can perform with ``atlas deployments`` include but
aren't limited to:

- **Set up** a new local or |service| cloud {+cluster+}, including:
 
  - Create the {+cluster+}.
  
  - Load sample data into the {+cluster+}.
  
  - Add your IP address to your project's IP access list (for |service|
    cloud {+clusters+} only).

  - Create a MongoDB user for your {+cluster+}.

  - Connect to your {+cluster+}.
   
- **List** local and |service| cloud {+clusters+}.
  
- **Connect** or return the connection string for a local or |service|
  cloud {+cluster+}.

- **Pause or start** a local or |service| cloud {+cluster+}.
  
- **Delete** a local or |service| cloud {+cluster+}.
  
- **Access logs** for a local or |service| cloud {+cluster+}.
  
- **Create or manage search indexes** to run |service| Search on a
  local or |service| cloud {+cluster+}.
